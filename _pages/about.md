Welcome! I am **Longge Yuan**, a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at **Florida State University**, specializing in **large language model (LLM) optimization**, **model pruning**, and **efficient inference system design**.

My recent projects include:
- **DISP-LLM**, where I reproduced and evaluated a state-of-the-art structural pruning method submitted to NeurIPS 2024.
- **TinyChat Engine**, a system-level project in which I developed loop-unrolling, SIMD, and multithreading-based optimization techniques to deploy quantized LLMs on edge devices, reducing token latency from 12.4s to 1.4s.
- A machine learning pipeline for **scientific data compression ratio prediction**, applying tree-based regressors with handcrafted statistical features.

I am passionate about applying LLM technologies to **resource-constrained settings** and **socially impactful domains**, including health informatics and edge intelligence. My academic experience is complemented by internships in **embedded system engineering** and **infrared-visual video fusion**.

This site presents my academic portfolio, including **projects**, **publications**, **coursework**, and a downloadable **CV**. Thank you for visiting!
